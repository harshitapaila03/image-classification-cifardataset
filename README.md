# Image Classification Using Neural Networks

## Introduction

Image classification is a fundamental problem in computer vision. This project focuses on classifying images from the CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains 60,000 32x32 color images belonging to 10 distinct categories. Using neural networks, we aim to train a model that can accurately categorize these images. By leveraging techniques like data preprocessing, augmentation, and deep learning models, we gain insights into the effectiveness of neural networks in image classification.

## Classification Workflow

The classification process is structured into the following stages:
1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Preparing the CIFAR-10 dataset for model training.
2. **Model Building**: Constructing a neural network for image classification.
3. **Training and Validation**: Training the model on the dataset and validating its performance.
4. **Evaluation**: Testing the model on unseen data and analyzing its accuracy.

## Features

### Data Preprocessing and Transformation
- Normalize image data to enhance model performance.
- Convert class labels into one-hot encoded vectors for compatibility with the neural network.

### Neural Network Model
- Build and compile a convolutional neural network (CNN) using TensorFlow/Keras.
- Employ techniques like dropout and regularization to prevent overfitting.

### Visualizations
- **Displaying Sample Images**: View examples of CIFAR-10 images and their labels.
- **Training Accuracy and Loss**: Visualize accuracy and loss metrics over training epochs.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Analyze the model's classification performance with a confusion matrix.

### Performance Metrics
- Calculate and visualize the model's accuracy and loss across training epochs.
- Use a confusion matrix for detailed performance insights.
